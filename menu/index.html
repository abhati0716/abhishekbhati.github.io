My overall goal was to use as much as possible produce from my garden. I have used several produce from the garden such
Bottle gourd, Green Chillies, Tomatoes. Over past few days, I have meticulous prepared the menu and tried to
cook dishes that I have never cooked before. For instance, Malai Kofta.

Please find the menu of the party below.
