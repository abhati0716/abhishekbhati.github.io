<p class-"lead"> I believe that every student should be treated as a gifted individual with diverse skills and
perspectives. This notion is guided by my personal teaching philosophy where I see my role as a
motivator and facilitator who helps each student achieve his or her true potential, while also
meeting learning requirements for each class. In order to achieve this goal, I strive to make the
learning process enjoyable and meaningful for each student by using multiple teaching tools such
as case studies, guest speakers, and reflective writing based on videos or movies related to course
content, in addition to standard lecturing and discussion techniques.</p>
