<p class-"lead"> I am interested in understanding how to further democratize nonprofit and civil society organizations by
	giving voices to the marginalized community and increasing their effectiveness to solve complicated problems arising from
	both government and market failure. My current research aims at understanding how growing competition to attract new donations is affecting
	nonprofitsâ€™ fundraising strategies, including social media usage for attracting and retaining donors and its effects on their organizational
	structure and relationship between beneficiaries or recipients</p>
