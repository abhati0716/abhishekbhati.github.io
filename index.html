	<p class="lead"> Welcome to my personal website.

	<p class-"lead"> I am Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/political-science.html">
		Department of Political Science</a> at the <a href="http://bgsu.edu/"> Bowling Green State University</a> (BGSU). My overarching research agenda lies at the interaction of nonprofit
		and civil society organizations, political science, and public administration. In particular, I am interested in understanding how growing competition to attract new donations is
		affecting nonprofitsâ€™ fundraising strategies, including social media usage for attracting and retaining donors and its effects on their organization structure and relationship
		between beneficiaries or recipients. Also, ways in which philanthropy can support diverse beneficiaries and create greater equity within communities locally and internationally. </p>

    <p class-"lead">I recieved B.A. in Business Economics from the <a href="http://www.du.ac.in"> University of Delhi</a>, M.A. in Social Enterpreneurship from the
		<a href="http://tiss.edu/"> Tata Institute of Social Sciences</a>, Mumbai, and Ph.D. in Public Administration from the <a href="http://unomaha.edu/"> University of Nebraka at Omaha. </p>
